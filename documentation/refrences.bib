	abstract = {We explore a novel, free-space optics based approach for building data center interconnects. It uses a digital micromirror device (DMD) and mirror assembly combination as a transmitter and a photodetector on top of the rack as a receiver (Figure 1). Our approach enables all pairs of racks to establish direct links, and we can reconﬁgure such links (i.e., connect different rack pairs) within 12 µs. To carry trafﬁc from a source to a destination rack, transmitters and receivers in our interconnect can be dynamically linked in millions of ways. We develop topology construction and routing methods to exploit this ﬂexibility, including a ﬂow scheduling algorithm that is a constant factor approximation to the ofﬂine optimal solution. Experiments with a small prototype point to the feasibility of our approach. Simulations using realistic data center workloads show that, compared to the conventional folded-Clos interconnect, our approach can improve mean ﬂow completion time by 30–95\% and reduce cost by 25–40\%.},

The characteristics of the physical network, such as bandwidth, MTU, delay, etc., ultimately determine the characteristics of the virtual network directly or indirectly. It can be said that the physical network determines the "ceiling" of the virtual network.},
